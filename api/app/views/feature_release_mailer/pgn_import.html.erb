	It's important when studying a repertoire to be able to fully understand the reason behind each move. <a target="_blank" href="<%= ENV["REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL"] %>" style="color: #059669;">Chess HQ</a> allows you to store not only a comment about each position, but now your board arrows will automatically save for each position. As you view the moves in your repertoire, the arrows will automatically update on the board. All you need to do is draw and enjoy!
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, we're aware some users have large repertoires stored as PGN files. We are happy to announce you can now import these into Chess HQ. All variations, comments, and arrows will automatically be added to your repertoire. To import a PGN, create a repertoire or access an existing repertoire, then click the "Import PGN" button in the area above the move list. This will be on the right side of your screen on a desktop or under the board on mobile. These features are free for all users.
